Three.js is a JavaScript library which is used to create and display animated computer 3D graphics on web browsers. Three.js library was built in conjunction with HTML5 canvas element, SVG and WebGL. It wrap up all these web technologies and provides a more sophisticated API where creating graphics is more easy. It is customizable where the developer can decide what should be the graphics renderer either it is HTML5 canvas or SVG or WebGL. 

The aim of this project is to port the Three.js library to C# with the capability of choosing the underlying renderer either OpenGL or MonoGame. But initially the implemented C# library will only support OpenGL as the back end renderer.
